An OpenAI-based Chatbot is an artificial intelligence-powered conversational agent developed using OpenAI's language models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). 
These chatbots leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand, generate, and respond to text-based queries.
